* Index-search (keyword search). I've been told that ScrollKeeper CVS
  has support for this, it should be used in Yelp.

* Support man/info (currently being implemented, or already done just 
  not commited by Patanjali).

* Support for external links (if a link points outside the documents the
  prefered web browser should be started to handle this).

* Generate HTML-indexes for sections without a document (when opening a 
  node in the tree, if that node doesn't have a document connected to it
  a HTML page should be generated, to allow the user to browse only in 
  the HTML widget).

* Create the tree out of information from the system 
  (somewhat fixed, SK support works).

* Nice start page. (TOC?)

* History support:
  (I have code for this from DevHelp which should be easy enough to
   bring over).  

* Bookmark support

* more?...
