FEATURES:
---------

* Index-search (keyword search). I've been told that ScrollKeeper CVS
  has support for this, it should be used in Yelp.

* Support for external links (if a link points outside the documents the
  prefered web browser should be started to handle this).

* Create the tree out of information from the system 
  - Add man  (Patanjali?)
  - Add info (Patanjali?)

* Home view:
  - The homeview should show the top two levels of the contents tree.
  - Clicking on a link in the home view should give you the contents-view 
    with contents-root being the node you clicked in the home-view.
  - Use toplevel for Info and Man.

* Generate HTML-indexes for sections without a document (when opening a 
  node in the tree, if that node doesn't have a document connected to it
  a HTML page should be generated, to allow the user to browse only in 
  the HTML widget).
  (might not be needed when we have the Home-scheme)

* Bookmark support
