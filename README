About:
------

Yelp is supposed to become a help browser for GNOME 2.0. The name Yelp
was suggested by Daniel Lundin. Yelp is pronounced the same as the
swedish word for 'help'.



Requirments:
------------

* GNOME 2.0 (beta4)
* A working ScrollKeeper installation ( > 0.3.6 ).
* Docbook DTD's/stylesheets 1.48

If the docbook -> html converting is really slow (like 30 seconds to 1
minute per document it means that your xml catalog is not correctly
set up). Please look in libgnome/help-converters/README to see how to
set it up.



Reporting bugs:
---------------

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product yelp.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.



Sending patches:
----------------

Please submit your patches to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GTK programming
interface, the API keyword should also be included.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)



Help on setting your system up:
-------------------------------

A brief note on how to get the docbook stuff to work. 

1) Install Scrollkeeper 0.3.6: 
http://apt-rpm.codefactory.se/mirror/extra/7.2/RPMS/scrollkeeper-0.3.6-1.i386.rpm
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scrollkeeper/scrollkeeper-0.3.6.tar.gz

Edit /etc/scrollkeeper.conf to include your $(gnome2_prefix)/share/omf
directory. For best use in GNOME 2.0, remove all other directories. 

Run scrollkeeper-update.
