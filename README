About:
------

Yelp is supposed to become a help browser for GNOME 2.0. The name Yelp
was suggested by Daniel Lundin. Yelp is pronounced the same as the
swedish word for 'help'.


Requirments:
------------

* GNOME 2.0 (beta2)
* A working ScrollKeeper installation (suggested > 0.3).
* Docbook DTD's/stylesheets

If the docbook -> html converting is really slow (like 30 seconds to 1
minute per document it means that your xml catalog is not correctly
set up). Please look in libgnome/help-converters/README to see how to
set it up.
