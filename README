About:
------

Yelp is supposed to become a help browser for GNOME 2.0. The name Yelp
was suggested by Daniel Lundin. Yelp is pronounced the same as the
swedish word for 'help'.

It uses the gnome-vfs help module from Nautilus (should this be moved
somewhere where all could use it, gnome-vfs?)

Support for different meta-data formats:
----------------------------------------

The help browser should support at least Scrollkeeper and the old
DevHelp format.

A start-flag '-d' to read metadata using DevHelp format would probably
do it. (not included yet).
