About:
------

Yelp is the default help browser for the GNOME desktop.  Yelp provides
a simple graphical interface for viewing DocBook, HTML, man, and info
formatted documentation.  The name Yelp was suggested by Daniel Lundin.
Yelp is pronounced the same as the swedish word for 'help'.


Requirments:
------------

* GNOME 2.0 ( >= 2.0.2 )
* A working ScrollKeeper installation ( > 0.3.6 )
* Version 4.1.2 of the DocBook XML DTD

Note that Yelp does not require the DocBook XSLT stylesheets.  Yelp
uses its own custom stylesheets, which are faster and allow better
integration with Yelp.


Reporting bugs:
---------------

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product Yelp.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.


Sending patches:
----------------

Please submit your patches to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GTK programming
interface, the API keyword should also be included.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)


Help on setting your system up:
-------------------------------

A brief note on how to get the docbook stuff to work. 

1) Install Scrollkeeper 0.3.6: 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scrollkeeper/scrollkeeper-0.3.6.tar.gz

Edit /etc/scrollkeeper.conf to include your $(gnome2_prefix)/share/omf
directory. For best use in GNOME 2.0, remove all other directories. 

Run scrollkeeper-update.
