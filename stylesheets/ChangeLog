	* docbook/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): added dtd

	* docbook/catalog.in: added, this is a local catalog for for Yelp.
	
	* yelp-customization.xsl: Reverted into having the URI for the
	  import of stylesheets. Now that I have my own catalog file
	  installed. 

	* docbook/dtd/*: Added the DTD 4.1.2 for now. Jamesh notified me
	  that this was needed. The long term solution would be not to
	  ship these at all but instead depend on the system to do this
	  correctly.
